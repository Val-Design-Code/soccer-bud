## Description


**What was your motivation?**

I've used to play professional football when I was at school and really got to like this sport. Usually I'd go with my friends and have some matches with adults on a pitch next to my house. When I came in the UK I've met the problem that I don't know anyone and I'm not able to gather a team to play with. I've looked on the internet and Apple Store for applications that would solve this issue and couldn't find one that would allow me to book a match and get in touch with my teammates. So I took this to develop this idea as part of one of my uni projects. 

**Roles**

I was responsible for the design:art: and coding all the Front-end of the project:framed_picture:.

**Why did you build this project?**

I've wanted to develop a website that would help solve my issues and making it as a part of my uni project got me the perfect opportunity to check the MVP and get some feedback and guidance from my tutors.
